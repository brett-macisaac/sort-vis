note: when testing PWA capabilities (use Chrome, not Firefox), I've found that if the 'Update on reload' checkbox is 
checked, this can result in the page not loading when in offline mode.

todo:
- The app appears to freeze when the sorting process is paused and the user steps backwards past the first action.
- fix the spacing on the buttons. Had a fix by reducing the button size to be 0.98 of what it should be, but this causes
  other issues, such as the elements no longer showing.
